                "The only real reason I got into IT is because I know there is'nt that much IT engineers in Mongolia and it made like a ton of money and I wanted to make alot of money because I like money , but when I got into Nest Educational IT school I was learning alot about IT just like how I'm using VS code to write this and ithought it was alot of fun and i did'nt really care about the money no more.<br><br> And not only just VS code I learned how to solve C++ problems in ITP and this VS code in ITW and Micro bit in IOT .<br><br> These are the classes I'm learning and I think it's going to help with these future robots alot."<br><br> -Buyanturs words no cap no cap
